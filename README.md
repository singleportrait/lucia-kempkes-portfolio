# Lucia Kempkes' Portfolio Site

https://luciakempkes.com

Based originally off [Next's statically generated blog using Next.js and Contentful](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/cms-contentful).

Other thorough documentation and additional notes are in the [Lucia Kempkes Tech Notes Dropbox Paper doc](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Lucia-Kempkes-Tech-Notes--A2ZF4df9MOhnBeG2AwsisAMJAg-eUaI6KAuBvR2NsF2W03ra).

## General info:

- Built with Next JS
- Paired with Contentful as its headless CMS
- Deployed on Vercel: https://vercel.com/singleportrait/lucia-kempkes-portfolio
- To run and deploy:
  - Start the server with `yarn dev`
  - By pushing an update to any branch, you automatically start a "Preview" Vercel build
- Notes to add:
  - Webhooks
  - Merging with main branch
- When getting it up and running, I generally followed the detailed instructions in the `cms-contentful` [readme](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/cms-contentful), especially around setting up the space IDs, setting up the ability to view preview content, and deploying to Vercel
